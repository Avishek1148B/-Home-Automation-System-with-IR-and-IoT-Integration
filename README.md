üè† Home Automation System with IR and IoT Integration


This project presents a Home Automation System that combines IR remote control and IoT capabilities for seamless operation of home appliances. Built with the ESP01 microcontroller and Blynk IoT platform, the system offers a cost-effective and user-friendly solution for modern smart homes.

Features
‚¶ø Dual Control: Operate appliances via an IR remote or the Blynk mobile app.
‚¶ø IoT Integration: Monitor and control devices from anywhere using a smartphone.
‚¶ø Cost-Effective Design: Minimal hardware requirements for an affordable automation system.
‚¶ø User-Friendly Interface: Simple setup for both IR and mobile app controls.

Tech Stack
‚¶ø Microcontroller: ESP01
‚¶ø Control Mechanisms: IR remote and Blynk IoT app
‚¶ø Integration: Blynk platform for real-time control and monitoring

Applications
‚¶ø Smart home automation
‚¶ø Remote appliance management
‚¶ø Affordable IoT solutions for households

How It Works
1.The IR remote sends control signals to the ESP01 microcontroller.
2.The ESP01 also connects to the Blynk IoT platform for mobile app control.
3.Commands from either source control the connected home appliances.
4.Users can switch seamlessly between IR and IoT-based control.
